### Meeting 10/04/2023 Summary:

For starters we summarized our progress in sprint one. We also had a conversation about our goals and achievements in sprint 1. 
We spectated our website through Discord and discussed things that needed some adjustements and changes (ie. background colour for index).
We all agreed to our goals in sprint two and started to work as a team and individual since we need to do an individual game in our assignment. 
Next meeting will be scheduled after our retrospective and evaluation made by our teacher. 

In sprint two we will focus on our individual goals more since we need to complete the game project. We will continue to have these weekly conversations 
and give assistence to our study group members if possible. Overall we all were happy with the results we got in the first sprint.
